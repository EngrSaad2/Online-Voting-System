## What is an online voting system?
#### A simple definition:
 
Online voting systems are software platforms used to securely conduct votes and elections. As a digital platform, they eliminate the need to cast your votes using paper or having to gather in person.
 
They also protect the integrity of your vote by preventing voters from being able to vote multiple times.
 
Many secure voting platform vendors provide supportive vote consulting services that help organizations design their voting procedures.
 
These services help organizations save time, stick to best practices, and meet internal requirements and/or external regulations, such as third-party vote administration needs.
